      <p className="Sub">Hey there! Thank you for visiting my portfolio.
      I've been programming since 2019. I started with Frontend languages like Javascript, HTML, and CSS. I eventually moved on to obtain a Full Stack Web Development Certification from Southern Methodist University where I added React.Js, Firebase, 
      and mySQL to my toolkit. I am passionate about programming because it allows me to merge both my analytical and creative skills into one profession.
